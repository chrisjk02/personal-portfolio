                    <div class="title">What gap we identified</div>
                    <div class="text">Although each app in our competitive analysis addresses many different aspects of
                        social interaction, there is a clear gap in solutions designed for people who have moved to a
                        new city and are seeking to make friends within their new community. Both Meetup and BarkHappy
                        target particular groups of people; Meetup is for event planners, while BarkHappy is for dog
                        owners. Moreover, The Nudge offers suggestions for activities, but it doesn't place much focus
                        on developing new friendships. </div>
                    <div class="text">Bumble, primarily a dating app, offers a friendship version where
                        people can meet others with similar interests, but it is not explicitly designed for those
                        recently relocated. Instagram and Snapchat are for general social media as they lack features to
                        help people with similar interests connect with one another. Identifying this gap, our proposed
                        app aims to provide a platform dedicated to assisting people who have recently moved to connect
                        with others in their new area, ultimately fostering meaningful friendships.</div>

                <div id="userResearch" class="flex-item">
                    <div class="title-md">User Research</div>
                    <div class="text">Our user research aimed to gather insights from individuals who had recently moved
                        into a new city, those who have moved before, and natives who wish to connect with their
                        community. We seeked to address the following key aspects through a series of structured
                        interviews: </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Moving Experience</li>
                            <li>Social Connection Strategies</li>
                            <li>Activities Preferences</li>
                            <li>Interaction with current community members</li>
                            <li>App Adoption Potential</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="text">The insights we gathered made it evident that our original problem statement did
                        not align with the needs of our target users and needed some refinement. The interviews revealed
                        nuances in how people approach moving to a new city and connecting with their community members.
                        We decided to modify our problem statement to better reflect our users' frustrations and ensure
                        our design process was addressing the real challenge our stakeholders faced.</div>

                    <div class="title">Some key quotes from interview participants:</div>
                    <div class="text">
                        <ul>
                            <li>“I expand my social setting if I go to a constant spot regularly and if I see familiar
                                faces, like at the gym.”</li>
                            <li>“I have trouble approaching people. I have a little bit of social anxiety, so it takes
                                me a while to say hello.”</li>
                            <li>“I’m not comfortable interacting with people I’ve never met over the internet. There’s
                                online actors, and you don’t know if there’s predators or catfishes- just can’t really
                                trust online strangers.”</li>
                            <li>“No, I don’t really interact with my neighbors, it’s very awkward.”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="text">These quotes helped identify pain points that would modify our problem statement
                        in subsequent iterations. One of the key things that we identified is that many of our interview
                        participants were hesitant to meet up with someone that they’ve only met online, citing safety
                        as their main concern. Many participants also stated that they meet friends through mutuals and
                        by going to locations that they frequent. Because of these insights, our team shifted our focus
                        from trying to help people make friends through the application to encouraging people to attend
                        local events or restaurants to potentially make connections at those locations. We focused on
                        the organic nature of how friendships develop rather than trying to force people to be
                        compatible over a phone screen.</div>

                    </div>
                    <div class="text">After designing the mid-fidelity prototypes and agreeing that we wanted to use the
                        layouts given in our high fidelity prototype, we began to draft up what could be our final
                        design on Figma. To start this process, we met to choose a color scheme as well as a font to use
                        for our high fidelity prototype. This allowed for consistency across the different interface
                        screens as we worked on our different pages. We incorporated many affordances, with clear
                        navigation icons on the bottom that are clickable, as well as a clear search bar.</div>
